=> we already got migrations to create user, password, failed_jobs, personal_access_token
=> as well as Model for 'User' is create so we don't have to create it by ourself
*) Steps:
    => create a 'UserController'

*) Password reset
    -> for password reset we will send email to reset the password
    -> php artisan make:model PasswordReset -c
    -> now we will edit some stuff inside 'PasswordReset' Model
    -> to send password reset url into user email we have to first configure the admin email for that we have to put some environment variable inside '.env' file
    -> also we will create a View that contain the password reset UI which will get send to email of that user
