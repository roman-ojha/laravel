=> we will use './routes/api.php' to use REST API

*) To change the prefix '/api' for api url:
    -> in that case we have to go to './app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php':
    -> and change the prefix method on api route:
        public function boot()
        {
            $this->routes(function () {
                Route::middleware('api')
                    ->prefix('<custom_prefix_for_api_route>')
                    ->group(base_path('routes/api.php'));
            });
        }
    -> or also we can just remove the prefix method if you want to use api route from '/'
    -> NOTE: if you have the route for api on '/' and route for web app on '/' then web app route have higher priority
    -> Sometimes we want multiple root api url path:
        -> EX: '/api/v1', '/api/v2'
        -> in that case we can specify into 'prefix' method and then we can also specify the base file path for that api routes
