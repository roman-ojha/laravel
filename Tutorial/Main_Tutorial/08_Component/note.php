    /*
        *) What is View:
            -> We put complete HTML part in here
            -> we use blade template engine for fast rendering
        *) Make View
            -> we can create view inside './resources/views'
        *) Call View
            -> and we can call it from routing './routes/web.php'
            -> also we can call view from controller
            -> we will use './app/Http/Controllers/UserControllers.php'
        *) Pass Data in View
            -> We can pass url parameter as data and get access by controller and then can pass it to View
            -> also we can pass any kind of data from controller to View
        *) Question?
            1. Why we create Controller from Command line but not View
