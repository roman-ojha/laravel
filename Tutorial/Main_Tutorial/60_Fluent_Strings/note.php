        *) Issue with previous string
            -> previously if we want to perform operation on string like make first letter capitalize, make last latter small
            -> in that case we have to do these operation one by one
        *) What is fluent string
            -> overcome that issue we can use fluent string
            -> we can chain the methods and no need to assign value every time
        *) Understand with example
            -> we will use './routes/web.php' for this example
