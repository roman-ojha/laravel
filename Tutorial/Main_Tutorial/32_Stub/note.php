    /*
        *) Why Use Stub Customization
            -> Stub is a Skeleton file of our Controller, Model, Component, View, Migration or Seeding
            -> so, the command that we use to generate Controller, Model, Component and the code that we get by default on those file can be able to determine by Stub
            -> So, for EX: while we will create controller using command what are the initial code that we get are defined inside the Stub
        *) Run Command
            -> first we have to public or we can see generate stub file
            -> php artisan stub:publish
            -> this will create stub file for all the file that can be customizable
        *) Customize Controller
            -> so now we will customize controller by editing the file on './stubs/controller.plain.stub'
        *) Customize Model
            -> we can do the same thing with model as well on 'model.stub' file
        *) Question:
            1. how we can customize Component Stub?
