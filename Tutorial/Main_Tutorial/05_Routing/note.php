        *) What is routing
            -> to create url for the new page
            -> in which url which page will open for that we have to do routing
        *) How to make routing
            -> web based routing is happing on './routing/web.php'
            -> so we will write '<file_name>.blade.php' file inside 'views' which will get route to the 'web.php' file
        *) What is Blade
            -> blade is a laravel template engine
        *) Pass data with routing
            -> we can pass the data through routing as /{url} we will explain about this on './routes/web.php'
            -> and we can pass the variable inside view as well
        *) Anchor Tag
            -> also we can go to another route from one view page
            -> like ex: we have done it on 'views/welcome.blade.php'
        *) Redirect
            -> we can even redirect to another page if someone try to open one specific page
            -> this example
