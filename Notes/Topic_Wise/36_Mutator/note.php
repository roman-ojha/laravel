        *) What is Mutator
            -> when we are saving data into database in that case we have to do some modification
            -> EX: when we will get the data from the user then while saving data into database if we want to add 'Mr. <user_name>'
            -> in that case we can use Mutator
        *) Make Controller
            -> we will use 'StudentController.php' Controller to insert data into database
        *) Make Model
        *) Make a Mutator function
            -> so we have to use mutator function inside Model
            -> so we will use 'Student.php' model to add mutator function
