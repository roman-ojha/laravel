        => To connect to the database and query into it there is 2 way to do it:
            1. QueryBuilder
                -> we use normal function with database classes
            2. Model & Eloquent ORM
        *) Get Result With Table Name
        *) Where Condition
        *) Find, Count
        *) Insert, Update, Delete
            -> We did operation on 'StudentController.php' file
        *) Question:
            1. do update operation if given id data exist or insert operation if given id data doesn't exist?
